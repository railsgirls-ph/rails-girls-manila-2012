### Pre-event Preparation
---------------------------------------

*   You can install <a href="http://guides.railsgirls.com/install/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> before the event but we still recommend you attend the installation party. <a href="http://guides.railsgirls.com/install/" target="_blank">Follow the guides.</a> If things go wrong, try again. If you give up, you definitely have to attend the installation party.
*   You can do your research and even create a Ruby on Rails application if you haven't yet. We recommend this way of learning. Try it alone. Those prepared can ask more relevant questions. Any or all of the coaches can answer.
*   Learn <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git" target="_blank">Git</a> if you haven't yet. We use you Git for source control management.
